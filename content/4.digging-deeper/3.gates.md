description: Gates is the way to inform your api consumers what actions are allowed on different models.

If you are not familiar with what a "Gate" is, please have a look at the [Laravel Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization).

Laravel Rest Api takes advantage of this feature to provide your frontend users direct access to the current authenticated user rights.

## Using gates

Gates are enabled by default. You just have to provide the one you want in your [search endpoint.](/endpoints/search#gates)

If you don't want to use this feature you have two ways to disable it:

### Globally

In your `config/rest.php` file, you can directly specify to disable this feature:

```php
[
    // ...
    'gates' => [
        'enabled' => false, // Switch this to false
    ]
    // ...
]
```

### Resource

If you want to disable this feature for certain resources only, you can use the `DisableGates` trait on your resource file:

```php[UserResource.php]
class UserResource extends Resource
{
    use \Lomkit\Rest\Concerns\Resource\DisableGates;
    
    // ...
}
```

## Policy messages in gates

To surface policy messages explaining authorization failures, first set the config `rest.gates.message.enabled` to `true`.
Enabling this changes the `gates` payload shape returned by the `search` endpoint and may require frontend updates.

In your policy, return an authorization `Response`:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Auth\Access\Response;
 
/**
 * Determine if the given post can be updated by the user.
 */
public function update(User $user, Post $post): Response
{
    return $user->id === $post->user_id
        ? Response::allow()
        : Response::deny('You do not own this post.');
}
```

This changes the `search` gates payload by adding the `message` to the gate

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "gates": {
        "authorized_to_update": {
          "allowed": false,
          "message": "You do not own this post."
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
